#Algo Rithms 2016-10-20
Welcome to the first Algo Rithms Meetup! Today we are going to try to implement some small and simple maze generator. 

You can start from scratch or you can use some of the templates provided for python or javascript so you don't have to deal with with the visualization of the result.

Enjoy!
